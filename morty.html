           <li> That, out there. That's my grave. On one of our adventures Rick and I basically destroyed the whole world. So we bailed on that reality and we came to this one. Because in this one the world wasn't destroyed. And in this one, we were dead. So we came here a-a-and we buried ourselves and we took their place. </li>

           <li>I'm Mr Meeseeks! Look at me!</li>

           <li>Awww, it's you guys! I know the two of you are very different from each other in a lot of ways, but you have to understand that as far as Grandpa's concerned, you're both pieces of shit! Yeah. I can prove it mathematically. Actually, l-l-let me grab my whiteboard. This has been a long time coming, anyways. </li>
